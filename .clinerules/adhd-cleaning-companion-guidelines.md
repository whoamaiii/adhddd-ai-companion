## Brief overview
- These guidelines establish the overarching principles and specific preferences for developing the "ADHD Cleaning Companion" web application.
- The focus is on creating a calm, supportive, and empowering user experience tailored to neurodivergent users, especially those with ADHD.
- The rules cover communication style, development workflow, UI/UX considerations, coding conventions, and project-specific design choices.

## Communication style
- Maintain clear, concise, and supportive language in all user-facing content.
- Use a calm and empathetic tone, avoiding technical jargon unless necessary, and providing explanations when used.
- Prioritize accessibility and readability in all text and UI elements to reduce cognitive load.

## Development workflow
- Emphasize iterative development with frequent validation of features against user needs.
- Prioritize accessibility, responsiveness, and simplicity in UI/UX design.
- Incorporate voice guidance and motivational support as core features, ensuring they are unobtrusive and easy to activate.

## Coding best practices
- Follow consistent naming conventions, e.g., camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for components.
- Use TypeScript for type safety and clarity.
- Write modular, reusable components with clear separation of concerns.
- Comment code generously to explain the purpose of complex logic, especially around user support features.
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling to ensure scoped styles and maintainability.

## UI/UX preferences
- Design interfaces that are minimalistic, with ample whitespace and calming color schemes.
- Use soft, muted colors to create a soothing environment.
- Incorporate visual cues and motivational messages that are gentle and encouraging.
- Ensure the interface is intuitive, with straightforward navigation and minimal steps to complete core tasks.

## Architectural choices
- Structure the app with a clear separation between presentation, logic, and services.
- Use React functional components with hooks for state management.
- Integrate AI analysis and plan generation as backend services, with clear API boundaries.
- Support voice guidance features with accessible, non-intrusive controls.

## Dependencies and libraries
- React with TypeScript for frontend development.
- Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules for styling.
- Use existing AI/ML services for image analysis and plan generation.
- Incorporate voice command libraries if needed for voice guidance.

## Testing and quality assurance
- Write unit tests for core logic and components.
- Conduct usability testing focused on neurodivergent user needs.
- Regularly review UI/UX for calmness, clarity, and supportiveness.

## Prompting and interaction
- When interacting with the user, be explicit about next steps and options.
- Encourage feedback on usability and support features.
- Maintain a flexible approach to adapt guidelines based on user feedback and evolving needs.
