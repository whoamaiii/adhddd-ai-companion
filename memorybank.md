- [x] Updated memorybank with core documentation references
- [x] Established documentation workflow for future sessions

## Task History

### 2025-06-29: Sensory & Feeling Tracker Implementation
**Duration**: Full implementation session
**Outcome**: Complete success

**What was built**:
1. **LogMomentPage.tsx** - Main data entry screen with:
   - Behavior selection grid (Stimming, Vocalizing, Withdrawing, etc.)
   - Environment factor grid (Loud Noises, Bright Lights, Crowded, etc.)
   - 5-point overall state scale (Calm to Overwhelmed)
   - Save functionality with haptic feedback

2. **TimelinePage.tsx** - Timeline view with:
   - Chronological list of logged moments
   - Color-coded state indicators
   - Expandable moment cards with behavior/environment tags
   - Empty state handling

3. **DashboardPage.tsx** - Analytics dashboard with:
   - Dynamic bar charts for most frequent behaviors
   - Dynamic bar charts for most common triggers
   - Static line graph for state over time
   - AI-powered insights placeholder

4. **BottomNav.tsx** - Navigation component with:
   - Home, Timeline, Dashboard, Settings tabs
   - Active state styling
   - Screen-based conditional rendering

**Technical Details**:
- All components built as React functional components with TypeScript
- State management through React hooks and prop drilling
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Glassmorphism design consistent with app theme
- Material Icons integration

**Integration Points**:
- Extended AppScreen enum with LogMoment, Timeline, Dashboard
- Added SensoryMoment interface to types.ts
- Updated App.tsx with state management and handlers
- Modified LandingPage.tsx to include launch button
- Added sensory tracker CSS variables to index.html

## Key Decisions & Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **State Management**: Using React hooks with centralized state in App.tsx
- **Navigation**: Bottom navigation for sensory tracker, header navigation for main app
- **Data Structure**: SensoryMoment interface with behaviors[], environment[], overallState number
- **Styling**: Consistent glassmorphism with new CSS variables for tracker-specific colors

### User Experience Decisions
- **Quick Entry**: Large, tappable buttons for fast moment logging
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded state indicators and selected button styling
- **Data Visualization**: Simple bar charts that scale dynamically with real data
- **Empty States**: Helpful messaging when no data is available

### Technical Standards Followed
- PascalCase for component files
- camelCase for functions and variables
- Props interfaces for all components
- Type imports from types.ts
- Consistent error handling and loading states

## Next Steps / Potential Tasks
- [ ] Add context note functionality to LogMomentPage
- [ ] Implement data persistence (localStorage or backend)
- [ ] Add filtering and search to Timeline
- [ ] Enhance dashboard with more sophisticated analytics
- [ ] Add export functionality for IEP reports
- [ ] Implement AI-powered insights
- [ ] Add settings panel for sensory tracker preferences

## Development Environment
- **Framework**: React 19+ with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS via CDN
- **Icons**: Material Icons (Outlined & Round)
- **Fonts**: Manrope, Noto Sans
- **Server**: Running on localhost:5173
